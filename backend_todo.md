# Firebase Backend Implementation Checklist

## Initial Setup

- [ ] Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console
- [ ] Register the iOS app with the Firebase project
- [ ] Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to the Xcode project
- [ ] Add Firebase dependencies to the project using Swift Package Manager
  - [ ] Firebase/Core
  - [ ] Firebase/Auth
  - [ ] Firebase/Firestore
  - [ ] Firebase/Storage (if planning to store images)
- [ ] Initialize Firebase in AppDelegate.swift or the app's entry point
- [ ] Create development, staging, and production environments (optional)

## Authentication Implementation

- [ ] Determine authentication methods to support:
  - [ ] Email/Password
  - [ ] Apple Sign In (recommended for iOS apps)
  - [ ] Google Sign In (optional)
- [ ] Create user authentication flow UI
  - [ ] Login screen
  - [ ] Registration screen
  - [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement authentication service class `AuthService.swift`
  - [ ] Sign up with email/password
  - [ ] Sign in with email/password
  - [ ] Sign in with Apple
  - [ ] Sign out
  - [ ] Password reset
  - [ ] Delete account
- [ ] Add user session management
  - [ ] Create a UserSession or UserManager class
  - [ ] Handle auth state changes
  - [ ] Persist logged-in state
- [ ] Add authentication state listeners to control app flow
- [ ] Update the app to require authentication before accessing questions

## Data Model Migration

- [ ] Design Firestore database schema:
  ```
  /users/{userId}
    - displayName
    - email
    - createdAt
    - lastLoginAt
    
  /subjects/{subjectId}
    - name
    - description
    - iconName
    
  /topics/{topicId}
    - name
    - subjectId (reference)
    
  /questions/{questionId}
    - type
    - subject
    - topic
    - skill
    - difficulty
    - questionText
    - originalMath
    - options (array)
    - correctAnswers (array)
    - explanation
    - lesson
    - images (array)
    
  /userQuizResults/{resultId}
    - userId
    - subjectId
    - difficulty
    - score
    - totalQuestions
    - completedAt
    - answeredQuestions (array of references)
  ```
- [ ] Create model extensions for Firestore compatibility
  - [ ] Add Firestore document conversion to Subject model
  - [ ] Add Firestore document conversion to Question model
  - [ ] Add Firestore document conversion to QuizResult model
- [ ] Implement data access layer methods for each model

## Update DataService Implementation

- [ ] Create a new `FirebaseDataService.swift` that implements the same interface as the current DataService
- [ ] Implement Firebase Firestore CRUD operations:
  - [ ] Fetch all subjects
  - [ ] Fetch questions by subject and difficulty
  - [ ] Add new AI-generated questions
  - [ ] Update existing questions
  - [ ] Delete questions
  - [ ] Save quiz results
- [ ] Add caching with Firestore offline persistence
- [ ] Add error handling for network failures
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets (if needed)
- [ ] Create data migration utility to transfer existing questions to Firestore (one-time)

## AI Question Generation

- [ ] Update `OpenAIService` to save generated questions to Firestore
- [ ] Implement user-specific ownership of AI-generated questions
- [ ] Add capability to share AI-generated questions with other users (optional)

## User Profiles and Progress Tracking

- [ ] Create user profile data model
- [ ] Implement progress tracking across subjects
- [ ] Store user achievements and statistics
- [ ] Add functions to calculate estimated scores (SAT, IQ, salary) based on performance
- [ ] Create leaderboards (optional)

## Security Rules

- [ ] Define Firestore security rules:
  - [ ] Public read access for standard questions
  - [ ] User-specific read/write for AI-generated questions
  - [ ] User-specific read/write for quiz results
  - [ ] Admin-only write access for standard questions
- [ ] Create validation rules for question submissions
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls

## Offline Capabilities

- [ ] Enable Firestore offline data persistence
- [ ] Implement proper synchronization when app comes back online
- [ ] Add UI indicators for offline mode
- [ ] Create a queue system for operations that require connectivity

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for FirebaseDataService
- [ ] Write unit tests for AuthService
- [ ] Create mock implementations for testing
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Test data CRUD operations
- [ ] Test offline capabilities
- [ ] Test synchronization
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Use Firebase Cloud Functions for complex operations (optional)
- [ ] Monitor and optimize network usage

## Analytics and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Track key user actions and events
- [ ] Create custom conversion funnels
- [ ] Set up crash reporting with Firebase Crashlytics
- [ ] Create dashboard for monitoring app usage

## Deployment

- [ ] Test the entire implementation in a development environment
- [ ] Gradually roll out Firebase implementation to users
- [ ] Monitor for issues during rollout
- [ ] Create backup and recovery strategy
- [ ] Document the new backend architecture

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement social features (friends, sharing)
- [ ] Add cloud-based synchronization across devices
- [ ] Implement push notifications for engagement
- [ ] Consider implementing Firebase Remote Config for feature flags
- [ ] Plan for scalability as user base grows
